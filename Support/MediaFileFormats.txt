Containers and Codecs
	Container
		A container (or file format) is like a box that holds audio data and metadata. It defines the file structure, how the data is organized, and what additional information can be stored (like album art, track titles, etc.).
	Codec
		A codec (coder-decoder) is the actual method used to encode and compress the audio data that goes inside that container.

LossLess / Lossy
	Several audio file formats can contain either lossy or lossless content.

	Summary
		MP4/M4A, WMA, and OGG are versatile containers that can support both lossy and lossless codecs.
		FLAC, ALAC, and APE are specifically designed for lossless compression but can be used within containers that support both types.
		WAV and AIFF are typically used for lossless audio but can technically contain lossy data.

		For these types, it often depends on the specific codec used within these container formats.
	Details
		AA (Audible Audio)
			Proprietary format used exclusively by Amazon's Audible audiobook service
			Contains DRM (Digital Rights Management) protection
			Compressed format optimized for spoken word content
			Can only be played on authorized devices/apps linked to your Audible account
		AAC (Advanced Audio Coding)
			Lossy
			Successor to MP3 with better compression efficiency
			Lossy compression format (discards some audio data)
			Widely supported across devices and platforms
			Common in iTunes, streaming services, and mobile devices
			Provides better quality than MP3 at similar file sizes
			Generally, not a real file container.  You might need to rename them to .m4a for better compatibility or convert them to a more standard container format
		AIFC (Audio Interchange File Format Compressed)
			Compressed variant of the AIFF format
			Can use various compression algorithms
			Less common than other formats
			Primarily used in professional audio applications
		AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format)
			Lossy: Uncommon, but possible.
			Lossless: Typically contains uncompressed PCM audio.

			Uncompressed audio format developed by Apple
			Lossless format that preserves all original audio data
			Large file sizes due to no compression
			High quality, often used in professional audio production
			Similar to WAV but with different metadata structure
		ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec)
			Lossless: Specifically designed for lossless compression.
			Apple's proprietary lossless compression format
			Reduces file size without losing any audio quality
			Smaller than AIFF/WAV but larger than lossy formats like AAC
			Primarily supported in Apple's ecosystem (iTunes, Apple Music, etc.)
			Good balance between quality and file size for archival purposes
		FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec)
			Lossless: FLAC is designed for lossless compression.
		M4A/MP4 (MPEG-4 Audio, MPEG-4 Part 14):
			Lossy: Typically uses AAC (Advanced Audio Codec).  Also, MP3
			Lossy Variants:
				AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) - Most common
				AAC-LC (Low Complexity)
				HE-AAC (High Efficiency)
				AAC-ELD (Enhanced Low Delay)
			Lossless: Can use codecs like ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec).
			Lossless Variant:
				ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec)
					File extension might be .m4a or sometimes .m4a-alac
					Offers bit-perfect reproduction of the original audio
		OGG
			Lossy: Typically uses the Vorbis codec.
			Lossless: Can use the FLAC codec within the OGG container.
		WAV (Waveform Audio File Format)
			Lossy: Uncommon, but can technically contain lossy codecs.
			Lossless: Typically contains uncompressed PCM audio.
		WMA (Windows Media Audio):
			Lossy: Standard WMA codec.
			Lossy Variants:
				WMA Standard
				WMA Professional
				WMA Voice
			Lossless: WMA Lossless codec.
			Lossless Variant:
				WMA Lossless
					Usually uses .wma extension
					Provides bit-perfect reproduction
	Checking
		To verify if your specific files are lossless:
			Check the bitrate - lossless will typically be > 500kbps for stereo
			Check the codec information
			Compare file sizes - lossless files will be much larger than lossy versions

			The codec used within the container determines if it's lossless or lossy
				Most M4A files in circulation are lossy AAC
				Most WMA files in circulation are lossy WMA Standard
	As of 2025, the most preferred lossless audio formats are:
		FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec)
		ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec)
Lossless
	APE (Monkey's Audio)
		Lossless: Specifically designed for lossless compression.
Lossy
	MP3
		Yes, MP3 files are always lossy. The MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer III) format uses a compression algorithm that removes some of the audio data to reduce the file size, which results in a loss of quality. This lossy compression is a trade-off between file size and audio quality.
