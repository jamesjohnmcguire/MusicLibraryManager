LossLess / Lossy
	Several audio file formats can contain either lossy or lossless content.

	Summary
		MP4/M4A, WMA, and OGG are versatile containers that can support both lossy and lossless codecs.
		FLAC, ALAC, and APE are specifically designed for lossless compression but can be used within containers that support both types.
		WAV and AIFF are typically used for lossless audio but can technically contain lossy data.

		For these types, it often depends on the specific codec used within these container formats.
	Details
		AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format)
			Lossy: Uncommon, but possible.
			Lossless: Typically contains uncompressed PCM audio.
		ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec)
			Lossless: Specifically designed for lossless compression.
		FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec)
			Lossless: FLAC is designed for lossless compression.
		M4A/MP4 (MPEG-4 Audio, MPEG-4 Part 14):
			Lossy: Typically uses AAC (Advanced Audio Codec).  Also, MP3
			Lossy Variants:
				AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) - Most common
				AAC-LC (Low Complexity)
				HE-AAC (High Efficiency)
				AAC-ELD (Enhanced Low Delay)
			Lossless: Can use codecs like ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec).
			Lossless Variant:
				ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec)
					File extension might be .m4a or sometimes .m4a-alac
					Offers bit-perfect reproduction of the original audio
		OGG
			Lossy: Typically uses the Vorbis codec.
			Lossless: Can use the FLAC codec within the OGG container.
		WAV (Waveform Audio File Format)
			Lossy: Uncommon, but can technically contain lossy codecs.
			Lossless: Typically contains uncompressed PCM audio.
		WMA (Windows Media Audio):
			Lossy: Standard WMA codec.
			Lossy Variants:
				WMA Standard
				WMA Professional
				WMA Voice
			Lossless: WMA Lossless codec.
			Lossless Variant:
				WMA Lossless
					Usually uses .wma extension
					Provides bit-perfect reproduction
	Checking
		To verify if your specific files are lossless:
			Check the bitrate - lossless will typically be > 500kbps for stereo
			Check the codec information
			Compare file sizes - lossless files will be much larger than lossy versions

			The codec used within the container determines if it's lossless or lossy
				Most M4A files in circulation are lossy AAC
				Most WMA files in circulation are lossy WMA Standard
	As of 2025, the most preferred lossless audio formats are:
		FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec)
		ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec)
Lossless
	APE (Monkey's Audio)
		Lossless: Specifically designed for lossless compression.
Lossy
	MP3
		Yes, MP3 files are always lossy. The MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer III) format uses a compression algorithm that removes some of the audio data to reduce the file size, which results in a loss of quality. This lossy compression is a trade-off between file size and audio quality.
