	Problem with ending number	The Very Best Of Ben E. King\Supernatural Thing, Pt. 1.mp3
	iTunes	Problem with searching for titles with dash ('-') in it, doesn't return results.  So, need to take dash out, perhaps other symbols too, such as [].  Create some tests for this issue.
	iTunes	Document building with UseItunes=true
	Merge Back In Library Variants	Deleting file from Server: 13 Jimmy Bishop Christmas Column.m4a	Merge 'iTunes Media.bak'

	File ending with comma?	Danny Singing With Mom and Dad, 1.wav	Entertainment\Music\Unknown Artist\Unknown Album\
	Review	That Lady, Part 1 (The one gets removed)
	Clean seems to be needed to run several times, in a row to 'catch' all the variants.  For some reason, not finding or processing all of the songs present.
	Clean seems to be not catching the extra numbers at the end: Danny Singing With Mom and Dad, 1.wav
	If song is an exact duplicate and then deleted, it should also be removed from iTunes.  This eventually happens, I think because of RemoveDeadTracks, but it should happen more immediately.
