# MusicLibraryManager
A utility to help you manage your music library, including files and tags.

Out music libraries get messy.  This is an utility to help get them clean up.

This, currently, primarily operates on a primarily based iTunes based library.  But a lot of the functionality is independent of iTunes and will continue to be expanded that way.

This has 3 main areas of functionality:
1. Cleaning up the tags (meta-data) inside the music files
2. Cleaning up the files, themselves, such as the filenames and paths
3. Cleaning up the iTunes connecting information about those files

All usual disclaimers are applicable.  Not responsible for damage or loss.  Backup! Backup! Backup! before usage

Currently, the rules and options on how to process are a bit 'baked in'.  Next step is to extract those rules and options, so that people can customize to their own likings.
